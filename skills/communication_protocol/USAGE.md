# Communication Protocol Skill Usage

## When to Use

**ALWAYS ACTIVE - Applies to every interaction.**

Load this skill when:
- Requirements are ambiguous or unclear
- Multiple interpretations are possible
- Missing key implementation details
- Unclear scope or expected behavior

## What It Provides

Protocol for asking clarifying questions:
1. **Ask ONE question at a time** (never multiple)
2. **Wait for answer** before proceeding
3. **Never assume** when you can ask
4. **Keep questions concise** (no option overload)

## Decision Rule

**When in doubt, ask.** It's better to get it right than implement the wrong thing quickly.

See `SKILL.md` for question patterns and examples.
