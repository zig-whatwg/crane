/// IDL:
/// ```

/// This mixin defines the readonly attribute that is shared by TextEncoder

/// ## Attributes
/// 
/// - `encoding`: The name of the encoding (always "utf-8" for TextEncoder/TextEncoderStream)
/// 
/// ## Usage
/// 
/// This mixin is included by TextEncoder and TextEncoderStream:
/// ```
/// TextEncoder includes TextEncoderCommon;
/// TextEncoderStream includes TextEncoderCommon;
/// ```
/// 
/// The including interfaces must provide this readonly field.
