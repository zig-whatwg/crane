/// IDL:
/// ```
/// interface mixin TextEncoderCommon {

///
/// ## Attributes

/// - `encoding`: The name of the encoding (always "utf-8" for TextEncoder/TextEncoderStream)
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// This mixin is included by TextEncoder and TextEncoderStream:
/// ```
/// TextEncoder includes TextEncoderCommon;
/// TextEncoderStream includes TextEncoderCommon;
/// ```
///
/// The including interfaces must provide this readonly field.
