//! GenericTransformStream mixin per WHATWG Streams Standard
//!
//! Spec: https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#gts-mixin
//!
//! This mixin is intended for use by OTHER SPECIFICATIONS (like CompressionStream,
//! TextDecoderStream) to create custom transform stream classes without directly
//! subclassing TransformStream.
//!
//! IDL:
//! ```webidl
//! interface mixin GenericTransformStream {
//!   readonly attribute ReadableStream readable;
//!   readonly attribute WritableStream writable;
//! };
//! ```
//!
//! NOTE: This mixin is NOT included by TransformStream itself. It's for external
//! specifications to use when they want to create custom transform streams with
//! their own interface names and behaviors.
