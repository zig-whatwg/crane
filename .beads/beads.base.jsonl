Extract to DocumentFragment\n    - Spec: specs/dom.md lines 5510-5620\n    - Complexity: HIGH (like delete but returns fragment, complex edge cases)\n    - Test: Extract text, extract elements, partial extraction\n\n11. **Range.cloneContents()** - Clone to DocumentFragment\n    - Spec: specs/dom.md lines 5630-5720\n    - Complexity: HIGH (uses cloneNode, preserves structure)\n    - **Requires**: Node.cloneNode() from Phase 1 ✅\n    - Test: Clone text, clone elements, partial cloning\n\n**Insertion (2 methods)**:\n\n12. **Range.insertNode(node)** -

updates tracked by range_tracking.zig\n- surroundContents validates that no partial nodes exist (except text)\n- All content mutations must fire mutation observers\n\n**Files to Modify**:\n- webidl/src/dom/Range.zig - Add all method implementations\n- src/dom/range_algorithms.zig - Create new file for complex algorithms\n- tests/dom/range_boundaries_test.zig - Boundary manipulation tests\n- tests/dom/range_content_test.zig - Content manipulation tests\n- tests/dom/range_comparison_test.zig - Comparison tests\n\n**Dependencies**:\n- Phase 1: Node.cloneNode() - REQUIRED for cloneContents()\n- src/dom/range_tracking.zig - Range updates (already exists)\n- src/dom/tree.zig - Tree operations\n- src/dom/mutation.zig - Mutation observers\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n✅ All 13+ algorithms implemented per spec (setStartBefore/After and setEndBefore/After count as 4)\n✅ Complex algorithms (delete/extract/clone/surround) handle partial nodes correctly\n✅ Range boundaries update correctly during mutations\n✅ Mutation observers fire for all content changes\n✅ All tests pass with zero memory leaks\n✅ Edge cases handled (collapsed ranges, detached nodes, partial containment)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-13T07:23:33.192679-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T16:51:09.319558-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-13T16:51:09.319558-05:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"whatwg-5a7b","depends_on_id":"whatwg-bxd7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-13T07:23:33.193336-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Context-insensitive (can't distinguish import types)\n2. Scope-unaware (can't track module vs local)\n3. Incomplete (misses edge cases)\n4. Cascading complexity (each fix needs more string manipulation)\n\n**Recommended Solution: AST-Based Codegen**\n\nParse → IR → Optimize → Generate\n\nBenefits:\n- Proper scope tracking\n- Clean optimization passes\n- Maintainable code\n- Future enhancements (dead code elimination, etc.)\n\n**Detailed analysis**: tmp/codegen_ast_recommendation.md\n\n**Decision Point**:\n1. **Quick workaround**: Manually add ShadowRoot to all Node children (30 min, technical debt)\n2. **Proper solution**: Implement AST-based codegen (6-7 hours, future-proof)\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- src/webidl/codegen/codegen.zig (allocator fix)\n- webidl/src/dom/Attr.zig (removed discard, added ShadowRoot import)\n- webidl/src/dom/Node.zig (added module-level ShadowRoot, removed local declarations)\n\n**Recommendation**: Implement AST solution.
