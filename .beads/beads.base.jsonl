Context-insensitive (can't distinguish import types)\n2. Scope-unaware (can't track module vs local)\n3. Incomplete (misses edge cases)\n4. Cascading complexity (each fix needs more string manipulation)\n\n**Recommended Solution: AST-Based Codegen**\n\nParse → IR → Optimize → Generate\n\nBenefits:\n- Proper scope tracking\n- Clean optimization passes\n- Maintainable code\n- Future enhancements (dead code elimination, etc.)\n\n**Detailed analysis**: tmp/codegen_ast_recommendation.md\n\n**Decision Point**:\n1. **Quick workaround**: Manually add ShadowRoot to all Node children (30 min, technical debt)\n2. **Proper solution**: Implement AST-based codegen (6-7 hours, future-proof)\n\n**Files Modified**:\n- src/webidl/codegen/codegen.zig (allocator fix)\n- webidl/src/dom/Attr.zig (removed discard, added ShadowRoot import)\n- webidl/src/dom/Node.zig (added module-level ShadowRoot, removed local declarations)\n\n**Recommendation**: Implement AST solution.

Two-step git mv creates duplicate file references. Need to either: (1) perform rename on Linux/case-sensitive FS, or (2) manually create new PascalCase files and delete old ones.
