The inconsistency exists in webidl/src/ which is not in git. Some files were created with snake_case names, others with PascalCase.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Confusing naming conventions\n- Mixed import styles\n- Hard to predict generated file names\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Standardize all source files in webidl/src/ to PascalCase\n2. Update codegen to enforce naming convention\n3.

Two-step git mv creates duplicate file references. Need to either: (1) perform rename on Linux/case-sensitive FS, or (2) manually create new PascalCase files and delete old ones.
