The inconsistency exists in webidl/src/ which is not in git. Some files were created with snake_case names, others with PascalCase.\n\n**Impact:**\n- Confusing naming conventions\n- Mixed import styles\n- Hard to predict generated file names\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Standardize all source files in webidl/src/ to PascalCase\n2. Update codegen to enforce naming convention\n3. OR: Add explicit file naming transform in codegen\n\n**Affected Files:**\n- webidl/src/dom/Attr.zig → webidl/generated/dom/attr.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Element.zig → webidl/generated/dom/element.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Node.zig → webidl/generated/dom/node.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Event.zig → webidl/generated/dom/event.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Comment.zig → webidl/generated/dom/comment.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Document.zig → webidl/generated/dom/document.zig\n- webidl/src/dom/Text.zig → webidl/generated/dom/text.zig\n\nvs consistently PascalCase:\n- AbortController.zig, EventTarget.zig, NodeList.zig, etc.\n\n**Related Investigation:**\n- Codegen uses pascalToSnakeCase() only for module imports, NOT file naming\n- File names are preserved from source\n- Source directory (webidl/src/) not tracked in git","notes":"Cannot complete rename on case-insensitive macOS filesystem. Two-step git mv creates duplicate file references. Need to either: (1) perform rename on Linux/case-sensitive FS, or (2) manually create new PascalCase files and delete old ones.
