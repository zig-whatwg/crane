Add all method implementations\n- src/dom/range_algorithms.zig - Create new file for complex algorithms\n- tests/dom/range_boundaries_test.zig - Boundary manipulation tests\n- tests/dom/range_content_test.zig - Content manipulation tests\n- tests/dom/range_comparison_test.zig - Comparison tests\n\n**Dependencies**:\n- Phase 1: Node.cloneNode() - REQUIRED for cloneContents()\n- src/dom/range_tracking.zig - Range updates (already exists)\n- src/dom/tree.zig - Tree operations\n- src/dom/mutation.zig - Mutation observers\n\n**Success Criteria**:\n✅ All 13+ algorithms implemented per spec (setStartBefore/After and setEndBefore/After count as 4)\n✅ Complex algorithms (delete/extract/clone/surround) handle partial nodes correctly\n✅ Range boundaries update correctly during mutations\n✅ Mutation observers fire for all content changes\n✅ All tests pass with zero memory leaks\n✅ Edge cases handled (collapsed ranges, detached nodes, partial containment)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-13T07:23:33.192679-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T16:51:09.319558-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-13T16:51:09.319558-05:00","source_repo":".","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"whatwg-5a7b","depends_on_id":"whatwg-bxd7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-13T07:23:33.193336-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
